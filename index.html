  <p align="center"> Since I know almost nothing about baseball,
    I'm about to tell you what little knowledge I have
    on the subject. Baseball is probably the most american 
    sport there is aside from football. During World war II, 
    since all of the men went to fight, there was no one 
    left to play the game. Everyone loved to watch baseball.
    The question was, Who would play? The shocking answer was
    the wives of the soldiers! yup, you read it right! and they 
    played the best games of baseball the league had ever seen.
    Because they did so well, The "All-American Girls Baseball
    Team" was created. Just watch the movie "A League of Their
    Own", it explains it much better than I do, plus Tom Hanks 
    is in it!
